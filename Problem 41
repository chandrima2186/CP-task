Question:Rhezo likes numbers of the form A^B. But computing A^B , for any 2 numbers A and B is a hard task for him. He would like you to help him out in this.
Input:
First line of input contains a single integer A. Second line contains the integer B.
Output:
Help Rhezo find A^B. As this number can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.  (Hackerearth)

const long long M = 1000000007;
long long p(long long a, long long b){
    long long r = 1;
    a %= M;
    while(b){
        if(b & 1) r = (r * a) % M;
        a = (a * a) % M;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return r;
}
int main() {
    long long A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;
    cout << p(A, B);
