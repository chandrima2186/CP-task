Question: Chef has an array nums of N balls, where each ball is painted red, white, or blue. The balls are represented by integers:
0 → Red
1 → White
2 → Blue
Chef wants to arrange the balls so that balls of the same color are together in the order:
Red, White, then Blue.
Help Chef sort the array in-place, without using any built-in sorting functions.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the number of balls.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, where each integer is one of:
0 → Red
1 → White
2 → Blue
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the sorted array of N integers, arranged such that all 0s come first, followed by all 1s, then all 2s.
