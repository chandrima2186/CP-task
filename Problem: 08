Question: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. (Leetcode)
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.  
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int x[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x[i];
    }
    int m = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        m ^= x[i];
    }
    cout << m << endl;
    return 0;
}
