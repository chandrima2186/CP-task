Question: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.   (Leetcode)
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?                         
Constraints:             
1 <= n <= 45


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a + b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return b;
}
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << climbStairs(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
