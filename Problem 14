Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).                                                                                                                                                         
Input: low = 3, high = 7   (Leetcode)
Output: 3
Constraints:
0 <= low <= high <= 10^9


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int countOdds(int low, int high) {
    return (high + 1) / 2 - (low / 2);
}
int main() {
    int low, high;
    cin >> low >> high;
    cout << countOdds(low, high) << endl;
    return 0;
}
