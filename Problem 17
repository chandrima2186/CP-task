Question: khba is writing his girlfriend's name. He has n cubes, each with one lowercase Latin letter written on it. They are arranged in a row, forming a string s. His girlfriend's name is also a string t, consisting of n
 lowercase Latin letters.
To prove his love, he must check whether it is possible to rearrange the letters of string s.so that it becomes her name t.
Input
The first line contains an integer q
 (1≤q≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤20).
The second line of each test case contains two distinct strings sand t, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" if the letters of s
 can be arranged to form t; otherwise, output "NO".
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
