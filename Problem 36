Question: Chef has two numbers A and B.In one operation, Chef can choose either A or B and multiply it by 2.
Determine whether he can make both A and B equal after any number (possibly, zero) of moves.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers A and B.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can make both numbers equal, NO otherwise.
Note that the checker is case-insensitive i.e. YES, Yes, yes, yES are all considered same.
Constraints:           (Codechef)
1≤T≤2500
1≤A,B≤50


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
bool canMakeEqual(int A, int B) {
    int X = max(A, B);
    int Y = min(A, B);
    int ratio = X / Y;
    if (X % Y != 0) return false;
    while (ratio % 2 == 0) ratio /= 2;
    return ratio == 1;
}
int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        int A, B;
        cin >> A >> B;
        cout << (canMakeEqual(A, B) ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
