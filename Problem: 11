Question: The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.  (Leetcode)
Given n, calculate F(n).                                                                                                                                               
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 30

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    if (n == 0) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (n == 1) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    int a = 0, b = 1, fib;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = fib;
    }
    cout << fib << endl;
    return 0;
}
