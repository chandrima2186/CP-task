Question: Superstar Dishes
Chef recently organized a Grand Feast where he served N different dishes to his friends.
Each friend picked their favorite dish, and now Chef has a list of all the dishes chosen.
Chef is curious:
Which dishes were so popular that they were chosen by more than ⌊N/3⌋ friends? Print the dishes in increasing order.
Can you help Chef find these superstar dishes?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the number of dishes.
The next line contains N space-separated integers Dish[i] — the dishes chosen by friends.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the dishes that were chosen by more than ⌊N/3⌋ friends, in increasing order.
Constraints
1≤N≤5×10^4                               (Codechef)
−10^9≤Dish[i]≤10^9

            count[x]++;
        }
        for(auto p : count) {
            if(p.second > n/3) cout << p.first << " ";
