Question: You are given an array A of size N and an element X. Your task is to find whether the array A contains the element X or not.
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and X — the size of array and the element to be searched.
The second line contains all the elements of array A
Output Format
Output "YES" if the element X is present in A, otherwise output "NO". (Codechef)
Constraints:     
1≤N,X≤10^5
1≤Ai≤10^5


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int N, X;
    cin >> N >> X;  
    int found = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;
        if (a == X) found = 1;  
    }
    if (found)
        cout << "YES\n";
    else
        cout << "NO\n";
    return 0;
}
