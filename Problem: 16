Question: Three leading AI-powered creative assistants—Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude—enter the first ever ASCII Art Contest, where they must impress a panel of human judges with their text-based masterpieces.
Each participant receives a score between 80 and 100 (inclusive). The organizers want to announce the final standing only if the judges' opinions are "close enough"; otherwise, they will ask the judges to reconsider.
Given the three integer scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude, determine the contest result:
If the maximum score and the minimum score differ by at least 10 points, print check again (the judging seems inconsistent, so the panel must re-evaluate).
Otherwise, print final X, where X is the median of the three scores (the score that would be in the middle if all three were sorted in non-decreasing order).
Input
A single line contains three integers g,c,ℓ
, representing the scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude respectively.     (Codeforce)
80≤g,c,ℓ≤100
Output
Print the required answer in a line.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int g, c, l;
    cin >> g >> c >> l;
    int mx = g;
    if(c > mx) mx = c;
    if(l > mx) mx = l;
    int mn = g;
    if(c < mn) mn = c;
    if(l < mn) mn = l;
    if(mx - mn >= 10) {
        cout << "check again" << endl;
    } else {
        int sum = g + c + l;
        int median = sum - mx - mn;
        cout << "final " << median << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
