Question: There is a contest containing 2 problems A and B. 2 strong participants P and Q participated in the contest and solved both the problems.
P made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants P A and P B respectively while Q made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants 
Q A and Q B. It is given that the time penalty is the minimum time instant at which a participant has solved both the problems. Also the participant with the lower time penalty will have a better rank.
Determine which participant got the better rank or if there is a TIE.
Input Format
The first line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, four integers P A, P B, Q A, Q B.
Output Format
For each test case, output P if P got a better rank, Q if Q got a better rank, TIE otherwise.
Note that output is case-insensitive i.e. P and p both are considered the same.
Constraints:
1≤T≤1000
1≤PA,PB,QA,QB≤100
