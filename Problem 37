Question: Alice has a positive integer N. She is wondering how many ordered pairs of positive integers (i,j) exist such that i+j=N.
Help Alice figure out the answer.
Note that since the pairs are ordered, (1,2) and (2,1) are considered different.
Note that:0 is not considered to be a positive integer.
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains a single integer N.
Output Format
Print a single integer, the number of ordered pairs of positive integers 
(i,j) such that i+j=N.
Constraints:   (Codechef)        
1≤N≤100


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    cout << N - 1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
