Question: Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.  (Leetcode)
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        if (x % 3 == 0 && x % 5 == 0) cout << "FizzBuzz\n";
        else if (x % 3 == 0) cout << "Fizz\n";
        else if (x % 5 == 0) cout << "Buzz\n";
        else cout << x << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
