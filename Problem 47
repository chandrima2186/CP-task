Question: Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand.
Alice has market data for N time points in the form of two integer arrays S and D. Here, 
Si denotes the supply at the i th point of time and Di denotes the demand at the i th point of time, for each 1≤i≤N.
Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the length of the arrays S and D.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers S1,S2…,SN.
The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers 
D1,D2,…DN.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.
Constraints:                  (Codechef)
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤100
1≤Si,Di≤100 for every 1≤i≤N
