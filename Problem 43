Input Format
The only line of input contains two space-separated integers A and B — the number of clouds Chef saw in the morning and evening, respectively.
Output Format
Output a single line containing the answer: Rain if Chef believes it will rain, and Dry otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e. the strings dry, Dry, DrY, and dRY are all considered equivalent.
Constraints:
1≤A,B≤20



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;
    if (B >= 3 * A) cout << "Rain";
    else cout << "Dry";
    return 0;
}
